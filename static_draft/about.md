# H1B Data Project

Minh Nghiem

## What is your current goal? Has it changed since the proposal?
The current goal is to provide a data-driven picture of the H1B process based on a rich beneficiary-based data released by the USCIS (obtained by Bloomberg). The project aims to provide clarity on the seemingly fair process, the trends it sees over the last 8 years, and supply historical information never before made about the outcome of H1B selection. Other than seeking to provide a reliable source of information for most things H1B-related to international students and their US counterparts, the project also seeks to address some immigration policy problems and what has and can be done to solve them.

It has not changed much from the proposal. Before, I was introducing the project mainly regarding the fraud that occurs. However, the project now uses that as a motivation to further explore the H1B process.

## Are there data challenges you are facing? Are you currently depending on mock data?
No on mock data. There are still ideas I have not implemented still figuring out chart type, but I anticipate that there is unlikely a data challenge that will be gravely detrimental to the main work. I still need to verify the correctness and consistency of one data source, but other than that, I'll be looking for an extra dataset of compensation by job code for Americans. Might be time-consuming to do cross comparison if they don't align with the job codes in form I129 for H1B filing.

## Describe each of the provided images with 2-3 sentences to give the context and how it relates to your goal.
1+2 provides an overview of the trend in H1B filings on petitioners and beneficiaries side. Supply remains stable, but demand increases radically the last few years. Why?
3+4 provides mapping of locations of employers filing petition and actual worksite of H1B beneficiaries who got accepted. Though we have reached the stage where most work goes beyond the geographic boundaries, this would be helpful to international students hopefuls in picking places to live.
5+6+7 provides profiling of filings in 2023, to further shed light on the real odds of the H1B lottery. I plan on using data from 2021-2024 for comparison in the final work as well.
8 provides a big picture of compensation by age for each occupation categories, also with gender markings. We could see to the types of jobs most occupied by a woman, as well as the base salary outlook for different types of jobs for H1B. If I could successfully find US workers' counterpart, I will add that to this graph as well.

Many other ideas not yet implemented (noted in draft.ipynb) but will be tested for viability at a later stage.

## What form do you envision your final deliverable taking? (An article incorporating the images? A poster? An infographic?)
A poster or infographic, with narratives embedded to guide the readers from beginning to end.
