A description of your subject area of choice. (1-2 paragraphs)
For a long time, US immigration policies have been a source of heated debate. While an US national may find their attention on borders and admission of refugees, international students in the US find themselves most hard-pressed on the nation's H1B policies, which comprise of laws and procedures for a non-resident to obtain the most common kind of long term work authorization in the states. Employing a lottery selection process, the system boasts fairness and pledges to serve the best interest for its native citizens. A recent Bloomberg report shows such is not the case, citing several successful efforts to game the system. This project aims to sheds light on the H1B selection process and what it means for both international job seekers and the US economy.
