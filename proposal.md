**A description of your subject area of choice. (1-2 paragraphs)**
For a long time, US immigration policies have been a source of heated debate. While an US national may find their attention on borders and admission of refugees, international students in the US find themselves most hard-pressed by the nation's H1B policies, which comprise of laws and procedures for a non-resident to obtain the most common kind of long term work authorization in the states. Employing a lottery selection process, the system boasts fairness, transparency, and effectiveness in the nation's best interest. A recent Bloomberg report shows such is not the case, citing several successful efforts to game the system. This project aims to sheds light on the H1B selection process and what it means for both international job seekers and the US economy.

**Your likely data sources.**

1. https://github.com/BloombergGraphics/2024-h1b-immigration-data?tab=readme-ov-file
H1B by individual records FY 2021-2024 data, sourced from USCIS and obtained by Bloomberg. Col estimate ~20, row estimates ~1,250,000. This would be the main source of data for analysis and visualization. Some questions that can be answered using that data are as follows:

What chances do a typical international entity have of securing a H1B? (BA vs. Master’s)—lottery and approval (classification)

Multiple registrations count vs. single?

Gender profile of petitioners?

How are work locations and employers location related?

Work type sponsorship by region?

2. https://www.uscis.gov/tools/reports-and-studies/h-1b-employer-data-hub
USCIS public H1B data. This will be used for time series analysis of aggregate approval over a longer time period. Col estimate ~ 6, row estimates ~ 400,000

3. https://www.bls.gov/cps/cps_aa2022.htm 
US labor data on wages and unemployment. This will be used to answer additional questions related to US economy/labor, such as "Does more h1b mean more unemployment for US native workers?", "How does compensation look like for similar title bearing US nationals? (average and occuption-based)". Col estimate ~ 2, row estimates ~ 30

**A list of any questions you have for us.**
None for now.
